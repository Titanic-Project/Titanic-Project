# Titanic-Project

# Description:

Most of us have watched the movie Titanic or know about this incident. So, with the data we have, can we calculate the passengers' survival rates? We calculated it with a rate close to 84%.

# Team & Roles:

Team name is TitanicTeam

Fatma KaradaÄŸ & Gizem Pesen 

Roles:

When we both add code and edit, we added or deleted the libraries necessary.
We used the articles on Kaggle to get enough information about our data.
We wrote all the lines of code together.
We just did the experiments on our own pc.
We thought theses about what the sub-problems would be.
We only divided the classification methods. One calculated score with the DecisionTreeClassifier and other with RandomForestClassifier


# Language, version, and main file: 

Python3 

Additional: 

One of us added the data of our data.
Generally, one of us opened the files and we mutually added and subtracted them.
The last commets we made are for you to gain better access and understanding because we added more clear comment lines and deleted some of them.
Our cross-code trials are a thing of the past because we've committed to it multiple times., but our experiments are either correcting the deficiencies or adding sub-problems (our theses) that we have produced.
